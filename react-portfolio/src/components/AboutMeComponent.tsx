        full-stack developer here, who loves bringing ideas to life with clean, modern code. 
        My go-to stack is M.E.R.N, but I'm always exploring new tools, frameworks, 
        and AI integrations to make user experiences smarter and smoother.
        <br /><br />

        I built everything from end-to-end web apps to sleek static sites using React, 
        balancing between front-end creativity and back-end logic. Certified in <i>AI-900</i> and <i>Azure Associate/Expert</i>, I 
        connect cloud solutions with intelligent app design. Outside of code, I'm gaming, playing piano, or hanging out with friends. Lifelong learning keeps me curious, creative, 
        and ready for the next challenge.
